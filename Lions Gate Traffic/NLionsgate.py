"""
Prints and saves bridge traffic speed/direction data from translink API.
In future, hope to incorporate a system where one would be able
    a) to send a text message requesting traffic data on LGB
    b) to send text messages reqesting traffic data for different lower mainalnd locations
    c) to be able to incorporate multiple people at once (i.e. someone else can send a text message and get the data back
