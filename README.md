# Open Data

Random files and programs that I wrote, roughly based around open data that I can find around the web or mathematical concepts.

### Lorenz
The [Lorenz System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is a system of ordinary differential equations, with chaotic solutions for many initial parameters. It was initially created to model atmospheric convection. In total, quite an interesting set of equations!
I created a short program to model these systems, using `matplotlib` to graph the output.

### NLionsgate.py
Vancouver Translink has an [open data API](https://developer.translink.ca) with many features, including speed of traffic at a certain position. Since I commute every day from North Vancouver to UBC, I have interest in the speed of traffic on the Lions Gate Bridge. I created this program to collect data on a Raspberry Pi, and to be displayed with Excel.
